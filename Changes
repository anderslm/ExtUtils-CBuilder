Revision history for Perl extension ExtUtils::CBuilder.

0.09_01  (Beta for 0.10 - untested!)   Sun Mar  6 09:45:12 CST 2005

 - Split out a few simple routines that format how compile switches
   are formatted, so that we can override them for platforms like VMS
   where they're very different.

 - Fix compile() on VMS, probably. [Help from Michael Schwern and
   Peter Prymmer]

0.09  Tue Feb  8 17:57:41 CST 2005

 - Fixed a broken link_executable() method on cygwin - it now uses
   'gcc' instead of $Config{ld} for the linking, because the latter is
   actually a shell script which calls a perl script which calls gcc
   in a way that only works for creating shared libraries, not
   executables.

0.08  Tue Jan 18 21:54:11 CST 2005

 - Fixed a testing error in which I had the prototype wrong for the
   main() function. [Jose Pedro Oliveira]

0.07  Wed Jan 12 21:50:34 CST 2005

 - Added the link_executable() method, which provides the ability to
   create standalone executables.  This is NOT yet implemented on
   Windows, and therefore the tests for it are skipped on Win32.
   [Alberto Manuel Brandao Simoes]

 - Integrated the latest split_like_shell() for Windows from
   Module::Build (really need to find a better home for this code...),
   which now does a much better job of handling quotes and backslashes
   and so on. [Randy Sims]

 - Fixed a couple of Windows problems related to the output-file name
   in link(), and some clobbering of the 'include_dirs' parameter to
   compile(). [Randy Sims]

0.06  Mon Dec 27 22:51:36 CST 2004

 - Fixed a bug on Unix environments in which our work-around for
   shell-commands like "FOO=BAR cc" (which is supposed to be turned
   into "env FOO=BAR cc" to actually work) wasn't being called.

0.05  Wed Oct 13 23:09:09 CDT 2004

 - Fixed a bug in split_like_shell() in which leading whitespace was
   creating an empty word, manifesting as something like "gcc - no
   such file or directory" during tests. [Spotted by Warren L. Dodge]

 - Incorporate another split_like_shell() fix from Module::Build.

0.04  Sun Oct 10 00:31:08 CDT 2004

 - Changed the split_like_shell() method to use the shellwords()
   function from Text::ParseWords (a core module since 5.0), which
   does a much better job than the split() we were using.


0.03  Fri May 14 23:12:23 CDT 2004

 - Fixed minor problems with the Build.PL file, the module names
   should be quoted.

 - The VMS module declared itself with the wrong package name.


0.02  Fri Feb 20 10:17:40 CST 2004

 - Fixed a bug in .../Platform/Windows.pm, in which compile() was
   ignoring an 'include_dirs' argument.  [Randy Sims]

 - Fixed a bug in .../Platform/Windows.pm, in which output files were
   being created in the root directory \ when they should be created
   in the current directory. [Randy Sims]


0.01  Mon Jan 12 08:12:35 CST 2004

 - Original release, taken from Module::Build's C-building code, with
   patching help from Randy Sims.
